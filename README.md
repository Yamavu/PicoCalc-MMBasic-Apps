some hopefully helpful scripts for MMBasic on PicoCalc

Tested with Pico 2W and Webmite 6.00.03

## Usable Scripts

* `player.bas` - MP3 Audio Player with Album Art
* `mmcalc.bas` - Spreadsheet Editor

## Unfinished Scripts

* `povray.bas` - crappy little raytracer for [POVRAY](https://www.povray.org/) files (WIP)
  * `testbmp.bas` - write a BMP to SD, could be seen as the high quality version of SAVE IMAGE

## Ideas

* Calendar
* MCalc, like MMcalc but textbased
